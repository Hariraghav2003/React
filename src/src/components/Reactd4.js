      <p>
        React Day 4 is aimed at learning about functional components, hooks, and
        React state management. Functional components are simpler and more
        efficient than class components, while hooks provide more control over
        the component's state and behavior.
      </p>
      <h4>Hooks</h4>
      <p>
        Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.Hooks allow function
        components to have access to state and other React features.
